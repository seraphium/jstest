<h1>Through the Looking-Glass</h1>
<div class="author">by Lewis Carroll</div>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1. Looking-Glass House</h2>
    <p>There was a book lying near Alice on the table,
        and while she sat watching the White King (for she
        was still a little anxious about him, and had the
        ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted
        again), she turned over the leaves, to find some
        part that she could read, <span class="spoken">
"&mdash; for it's all in some language I don't know,"
</span> she said to herself.</p>
    <p>It was like this.</p>
    <div class="poem">
        <h3 class="poem-title">YKCOWREBBAJ</h3>
        <div class="poem-stanza">

    <p>She puzzled over this for some time, but at last
        a bright thought struck her. <span class="spoken">
"Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course! And if
I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the
right way again."</span></p>
    <p>This was the poem that Alice read.</p>

<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
    on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
    and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
    created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
    that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
    dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
    battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
    portion of that field as a final resting-place for those
    who here gave their lives that the nation might live. It
    is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
    But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot
    consecrate, we cannot hallow, this ground.</p>
<a href="#" class="more">read more</a>
<p>The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
    consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
    detract. The world will little note, nor long remember,
    what we say here, but it can never forget what they did
    here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
    here to the unfinished work which they who fought here
    have thus far so nobly advanced.</p>
<p>It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
    task remaining before us&mdash; that from these honored
    dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
    they gave the last full measure of devotion&mdash; that
    we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
    died in vain&mdash; that this nation, under God, shall
    have a new birth of freedom and that government of the
    people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish
    from the earth.</p>
