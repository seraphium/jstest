    <p class="square">Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are
        Squares (to which class I myself belong) and Five-Sided
        Figures or <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon">Pentagons
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p class="nobility hexagon">Next above these come the
        Nobility, of whom there are several degrees, beginning at
        Six-Sided Figures, or <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">Hexagons</a>,
        and from thence rising in the number of their sides till
        they receive the honourable title of <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon">Polygonal</a>,
        or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides
        becomes so numerous, and the sides themselves so small,
        that the figure cannot be distinguished from a <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circle</a>, he
        is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is
        the highest class of all.

    <p><span class="pull-quote">It is a <span class="drop">Law
of Nature</span> with us that a male child shall have
<strong>one more side</strong> than his father</span>, so
        that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in
        the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a
        Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon;
        and so on.
